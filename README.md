# Departing Bandits Project
This project falls under the field of Online Learning, specifically in the domain of sequential decision-making and multi-armed bandits (MABs).

This project provides an in-depth summary and analysis of the paper "Modeling Attrition in Recommender Systems with Departing Bandits" by Ben-Porat et al. (2022). The paper introduces the departing bandits framework, an extension of the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, which models user attrition in recommender systems. Traditional MAB models optimize decision-making by balancing exploration and exploitation, but they assume a fixed interaction length with users. However, in many real-world applications—such as online platforms, subscription-based services, and personalized recommendations—users may leave permanently if they are dissatisfied with their recommendations. The departing bandits model accounts for this by incorporating policy-dependent user departures, allowing for more realistic decision-making strategies that aim to maximize both short-term rewards and long-term user engagement.

Additionally, this project extends the original framework by proposing Departing Bandits with Network Effects (DBNA), which introduces user interactions and cost-based user acquisition strategies. While the departing bandits model assumes that user engagement depends only on their individual satisfaction, real-world recommender systems often experience network effects, where user engagement is influenced by the number of other active users in the system. Furthermore, platforms must decide how much to invest in attracting new users, introducing a new cost-based trade-off between user acquisition and retention. Our extension, DBNA, integrates these aspects by introducing dynamic departure probabilities that depend on the number of users and a cost function that determines how many users the system should acquire at a given time. This leads to a more adaptive and realistic optimization problem, where the platform must balance recommendation quality, user retention, and acquisition costs.
